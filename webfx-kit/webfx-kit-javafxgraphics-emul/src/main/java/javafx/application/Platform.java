     * the caller. The Runnables are executed in the order they are posted.
     * A runnable passed into the runLater method will be
     * executed before any Runnable passed into a subsequent call to runLater.
     * If this method is called after the JavaFX runtime has been shutdown, the
     * call will be ignored: the Runnable will not be executed and no

     * NOTE: applications should avoid flooding JavaFX with too many
     * pending Runnables. Otherwise, the application may become unresponsive.
     * Applications are encouraged to batch up multiple operations into fewer
     * runLater calls.
     * Additionally, long-running operations should be done on a background
     * thread where possible, freeing up the JavaFX Application Thread for GUI
     * operations.

     * the FX runtime is initialized by the launcher before the Application
     * class is loaded.
     * For Swing applications that use JFXPanel to display FX content, the FX
     * runtime is initialized when the first JFXPanel instance is constructed.
     * For SWT application that use FXCanvas to display FX content, the FX
     * runtime is initialized when the first FXCanvas instance is constructed.
