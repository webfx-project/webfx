/**
 * Event dispatcher which introduces event dispatch phase specific methods -
 * {@code dispatchCapturingEvent} and {@code dispatchBubblingEvent}. These
 * are used in the {@code BasicEventDispatcher.dispatchEvent} implementation,
 * but because they are public they can be called directly as well. Their
 * default implementation does nothing and is expected to be overridden in
 * subclasses. The {@code BasicEventDispatcher} also adds possibility to chain
 * event dispatchers. This is used together with the direct access to the phase
 * specific dispatch methods to implement {@code CompositeEventDispatcher}.
 * <p>
 * An event dispatcher derived from {@code BasicEventDispatcher} can act as
 * a standalone event dispatcher or can be used to form a dispatch chain in
 * {@code CompositeEventDispatcher}.
