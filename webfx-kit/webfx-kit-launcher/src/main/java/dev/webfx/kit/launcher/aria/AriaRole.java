 * Enum representing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles as defined by W3C.

 * 1. Document Structure roles - Used to describe the structure of a document
 * 2. Widget roles - Used to describe common UI widgets
 * 3. Landmark roles - Used to identify large content areas for easy navigation
 * 4. Live Region roles - Used to indicate regions that may change dynamically
 * 5. Window roles - Used to describe dialog windows
 * 6. Abstract roles - Base roles that are typically not used directly
